# Coursera-Web-Course
I audited a web development course on Coursera from John Hopkins University and these were my projects

I was tasked with completing some projects at the end of each part of the course that I took. Here are the results.

The results of the site (please excuse the ugly main page that I used for testing) can be seen at https://teenagemutantcoder.github.io/Coursera-Web-Course
